2.1 Introduction                       *EasyColour-intro*                   {{{2

	This plugin makes it really easy to create your own colour scheme for Vim.
	You don't need to understand the syntax of Vim script and if you want to
	base your colour scheme on an existing one, you can!

	The plugin was originally written in order to make it easier for people to
	use my |TagHighlight| plugin, available from here:
>
		http://www.cgtk.co.uk/taghighlight
<
	The |TagHighlight| plugin highlights the names of classes, variables, types
	etc in source code in Vim. This makes it quicker and easier to spot errors
	in your code.  However, most Vim colour schemes don't support these extra
	groups.  By default, |TagHighlight| will simply highlight them all in the
	same way as Keywords, but it can be useful to have a means of
	distinguishing between them more clearly.

	EasyColour also allows you to 'scratch an itch': change a little detail on
	an existing colour scheme.  For example, if you really like the "desert"
	colour scheme but want the comments to be green, that can be done very
	easily!

	Finally, if you want to create a new colour scheme from scratch, it's much
	easier with EasyColour.

2.2 Installation                       *EasyColour-install*                 {{{2

2.2.1 With Pathogen                    *EasyColour-install-pathogen*        {{{3

	If you don't know what pathogen is and aren't interested, please ignore
	this section and see |EasyColour-install-no-pathogen|.  If you don't know
	what it is and do care, please see:
>
		https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
<
	If you've got pathogen installed, unzip the EasyColour zip file into your
	pathogen bundles directory; nothing else needs to be done!

2.2.1 Without Pathogen                 *EasyColour-install-no-pathogen*     {{{3

	To install without pathogen, simply unzip the EasyColour zip file into
	your ~/.vim or vimfiles directory (depending on your platform).  In your
	vimrc, select a colour scheme using the |colorscheme| command.

2.3 Simple Colour Schemes              *EasyColour-simple*                  {{{2

	An EasyColour colour scheme consists of two files, both placed in the
	"colors" directory in your ~/.vim or vimfiles directory.  These should
	have the same name, but one should have the extension ".vim" and one
	should have the extension ".txt".  Assuming a colour scheme called
	"my_colour_scheme", create two files: ~/.vim/colors/my_colour_scheme.vim
	and ~/.vim/colors/my_colour_scheme.txt (substitute ~/.vim with the path to
	your vimfiles directory if you're on Windows).

	my_colour_scheme.vim should look like this:
>
		set background=light
		hi clear
		if exists("syntax_on")
			syntax reset
		endif
		call EasyColour#ColourScheme#LoadColourScheme('my_colour_scheme')
<
	The ONLY things you'll need to change for your colour scheme are:
		
		* The name (near the end of the last line);
		* If you want a dark background, replace "light" with "dark" on the
		  first line.

	All of the colour customisation is done in my_colour_scheme.txt.  The
	format of this is very simple.  An example is below:
>
		# Saving this file will update the current colour scheme.
		Basis:default
		Light:
			Comment:DarkGreen
			Error:Yellow,Red
			Class:Blue
			DefinedName:Blue
			EnumerationValue:#880000
			EnumerationName:#880000
			Member:DarkBlue
			Union:DarkGreen
			GlobalVariable:Red
			LocalVariable:Red
			GlobalConstant:Red

		# vim: ff=unix:noet:ft=EasyColour
<
	Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.  The first
	line that does anything is 'Basis:default'.  This tells EasyColour that
	you want your colour scheme to be based on Vim's default colour scheme.
	If you want to create a colour scheme from scratch, either omit this line
	or use 'Basis:None'.

	Since we're using a light background, the next line is 'Light:'.  This
	specifies that all of the following colours are for a light background.
	Each line after that starts with a single tab character (a hard tab, not
	spaces), then a highlight group, a colon (:) and then a colour
	specification.

	Where that colour is a simple colour name (e.g. DarkGreen), it will be set
	as the foreground colour for that highlight group.  So in the above
	example, comments will be highlighted with the normal background colour
	(white for the default colour scheme) and with the text in dark green.

	Where the colour is defined as a '#' symbol followed by six hexadecimal
	characters, this will be used as an RGB colour.  For example, #880000 is a
	pale browny-red.  There are lots of HTML colour wheels online that make it
	easy to find these colours.

	Where the colour is defined as several comma-separated entries, they will
	be treated as (in order):

		* Foreground Colour
		* Background Colour
		* Special Colour (the colour of undercurls)
		* Style (choose from 'Underline', 'Undercurl', 'Bold' etc)
	
	So the line 'Error:Yellow,Red' will make errors be shown as yellow text on
	a red background.  There are other ways to define colours as well; these
	are detailed in |EasyColour-format|.

	The special colour is treated slightly differently in non-GUI Vim.  It is
	usually set in order to specify the colour of an undercurl.  However, in
	non-GUI Vim, undercurls are not supported and they are replaced with an
	underline in the foreground colour.  Therefore, the 'special colour' is
	used as the foreground colour in non-GUI Vim unless the foreground colour
	is set explicitly (in which case it is ignored).

	The last line in the file is a Vim |modeline| that keeps the file format
	as Unix (so it works on Linux and Windows), ensures tabs are not expanded
	(as you need a hard tab at the start of some lines) and tells Vim it's an
	EasyColour colour scheme so that it gets highlighted in its own colours.

	There are some more examples in the "colors/" directory in the EasyColour
	distribution.

2.5 Highlight Group Reference          *EasyColour-highlight*               {{{2

	There's a list of a lot of the built-in highlight groups in the Vim help
	for |group-name|.  |TagHighlight| adds lots more depending on the programming
	language that you're using.  See |TagHighlight-language-colours| for
	details on how to find the list of highlight groups for your programming
	language.
